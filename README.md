# IceCream
Ice cream order simulation app - school project - C++

Developed using C++

This ice cream ordering app was developed as a school project during my C++ programming class at Calhoun Community College.
There were several specifications that I had to follow, but I learned many, many things along the way.

Some parts of the ice cream app need to be updated. The ice cream app first lists the different frozen treats that are available
to be ordered and then asks the user if they would like to order. The program will then prompt the user for cup/cone, treat size,
and amount of toppings. It will then generate a unique receipt for each order. The frozen treats list is pulled from the file
"inventory.txt" and the toppings list is pulled from the "toppings.txt". The receipt is printed out in the "receipt.txt" file.
This program also has administrator functionality--it allows for searching and sorting of inventory and toppings, and also allows
for the entering of sales data.

What I learned developing this program:
-Bubble sorting
-Linear searching
-Proper uses of classes
-Enum data types
-Uses of header files
-and much more!
